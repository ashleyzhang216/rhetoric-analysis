Now we have a president who not only is an embarrassment to this country, frankly, he’s an embarrassment to the entire world. This is a president who thinks that climate change is a hoax. I think Donald Trump is a hoax, and our administration will listen to the scientists, not right-wing extremists. And what the scientists are telling us is that climate change is an existential threat to our country and to the entire planet. What they are telling us is that the oceans and the sea levels are rising and that means that great American cities like Miami, like Charleston, South Carolina, like Myrtle beach, South Carolina, like New Orleans, like New York City will be partially or maybe even completely underwater by the end of the century if we do not get our act together.

Well, under our administration, we will get our act together, we’re going to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. We are going to move forward toward a Green New Deal which transforms our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, and creates up to 20 million good-paying jobs in the process. 

Tired of hearing about the fact that the government is doing too little on climate change.
