Tonight, the fossil fuel industry continues to receive 100s of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet.

So please don’t tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry, and nothing happens unless we do that.

Look, on this issue, my friends, there is no choice. We have got to be super aggressive, if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable. So I don’t disagree with Tim. What that means is we got to A, take on the fossil fuel industry. B, it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and a hell of a lot of good union jobs as we do that. We’ve got to transform our transportation system and we have to lead the world because this is not just an American issue.
