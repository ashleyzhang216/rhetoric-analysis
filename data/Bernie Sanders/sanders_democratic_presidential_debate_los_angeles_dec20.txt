Tim, in all due respect, your question misses the mark. It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You’re talking about the Paris Agreement, that’s fine. Ain’t enough. We have got to, and I’ve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world. Instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.

I will answer that question, but I wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment because I do believe this is the existential issue.

I certainly can because people of color, in fact, are going to be the people suffering most if we do not deal with climate change. 

We are facing an existential crisis of climate change.
