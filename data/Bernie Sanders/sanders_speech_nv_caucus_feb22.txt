And when we talk about the major crises facing this country, it is a sad state of affairs when we have a President of the United States who believes that climate change is a hoax. Well the scientific community has a slight disagreement with Mr. Trump. They think that climate change is an existential threat to this planet. And our administration believes in science, not right wing extremism. And that is why together we are going to adopt the principles of the Green New Deal. Which creates up to 20 million good paying jobs as we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

Brothers and sisters, this is a moral issue. We must make sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable.
