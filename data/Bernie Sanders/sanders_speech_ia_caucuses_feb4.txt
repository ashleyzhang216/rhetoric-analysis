And unlike the President of the United States, the American people understand that climate change is not a hoax, but is an existential threat to our country and the entire world. They understand that the time is now for us to take on the fossil fuel industry, to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energies. And as President of the United States, because this is a global issue, not just an American issue, we are going to speak to the people in China and Russia and countries all over this world and say, maybe just maybe instead of spending 1.8 trillion dollars a year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.
