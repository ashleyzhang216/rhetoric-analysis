we understand that climate change is not a hoax, but an existential threat to this country and to the world.

Whether it relates to the corona virus or whether it relates to climate change, we believe in science. We believe that the time is now to tell the fossil fuel industry that they cannot continue to destroy this planet and that we will transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We will do that under the principles of a Green New Deal, which will create up to 20 million good paying jobs. 

That we do what the scientists are telling us we should do, aggressively combat climate change. What is so radical and extreme about those ideas?

That instead of denying the reality of climate change, we are going to lead the world in transforming our energy system.
